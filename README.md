## Overview

This project was to determine the six Keplerian orbital elements of a satellite's from 3 initial angle-only observations. We also propagate the satelite's orbit forward in time using ODE45, but we included the Keplerian method of propogation since it is discussed in the report. 

### Running

For an example of how to run this program run main.m

This determins orbits of 2 different sattelites from the same observation point in Tucson, AZ.
