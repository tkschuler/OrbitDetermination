## Overview

This project was to determine the six kepelerian orbital elements of a satellite's from 3 intial angle-only observations. We also propagate the sattelite's orbit forward in time using both ode45 and kepelerian methods. 

### Running

For an example of how to run this program run main.m

This determins orbits of 2 different sattelites from the same observation point in Tucson, AZ.
